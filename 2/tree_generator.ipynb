    "\n",
    "The assignment consists in the development, in NLTK, OpenNLP, SketchEngine or GATE/Annie a pipeline that, starting from a text in input, in a given language (English, French, German and Italian are admissible) outputs the syntactic tree of the sentence itself, intended as a tree with root in S for sentence, and leaves on the tokens labelled with a single Part-of-speech. The generation of the tree can pass through one of the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) PURE SYMBOLIC. The tree is generated by a LR analysis with CF LL2 grammar as a base. Candidates can assume the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) Adjectives in English and German shall be only prefixed to nouns, whilst in French and Italian are only suffixed;\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Verbs are all at present tense;\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) No pronouns are admitted;\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Only one adverb is admitted, always post-poned with respect to the verb (independently of the language, and the type of adverb);\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall the point above map a system that could be devised in regular expressions, but a Context-free grammar would be simpler to     \n",
    "    define. Candidate can either define a system by themselves or use a syntactic tree generation system that can be found on GitHub. \n",
    "    Same happens for POS-tagging, where some of the above mentioned systems can be customized by existing techniques that are available\n",
    "    in several fashions (including a pre-defined NLTK and OpenNLP libraries for POS-tagging and a module in GATE for the same purpose. Ambiguity \n",
    "    should be blocked onto first admissible tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) PURE ML. Candidates can develop a PLM with one-step Markov chains to forecast the following token, and used to generate the forecast of the\n",
    "     POS tags to be attributed. In this case the PLM can be generated starting with a Corpus, that could be obtained online, for instance by \n",
    "     using the Wikipedia access API, or other available free repos (including those available with SketchEngine. In this approach, candidates should\n",
    "     never use the forecasting to approach the determination of outcomes (for this would be identical purpose of distinguishing EN/non ENG (and\n",
    "     then IT/non IT, FR/not FR or DE/not DE) but only to identify the POS model in a sequence. In this case, the candidate should output the most\n",

    "\n",
    "Candidates are free to employ PURE ML approach to simplify, or pre-process the text in order to improve the performance of a PURE SYMBOLIC approach while generating a mixed model."
